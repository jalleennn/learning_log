Superuser is a user that has all privileges to see plethora of data of other users on the site. Registered users have trust in administrators to keep such info discreet.In creating a password in terminal, there no echo input is shut down to avoid shoulder surfing, terminal is not a GUI. Terminals are text streams and not a visual surface.

Django stores passwords as hashes, even the administrators can't be able to access it. Good to prevent attackers from reading original passwords.
Hashes consists of [Algorithm, Number of Iterations, Salt, hashed password]

Foreign key is a database term that connects each entry to a specific topic/ a key that links between each two pieces of data

Django shell in the terminal useful for testing & troubleshooting projects

url = destinations (address the users types in the browser)
path = directions ( functions that Django matches the URL)
parts of a URL : Scheme, Domain, Port, Path, Query. SDPPQ
Matching of urls is the succesful comparison of the path requested and the (url.py) file and extraction 
Macthing of url consist of static and Dynamic.
After the linked view is called.
Over time when you use path() function in place of url , there is no need for raw string (r) and regex symbols like $, ^, +, \d
Can only be used when you use re-path.  
This is all because path is not regex-based.
Regex is a pattern for matching text. (Regular Expression)
Raw string takes the codes for what ever it is. It doesn't autocorrect it.
Template is the structure of the web page

Parent template needed for making websites with lot of pages easier. Pass the {% extend %} tag on the other child templates, so you don't have to do it continually create new ones.
Child template needed for could inherit from the parent template and write new stuff in that page using the {% block content%} and {% endblock content%} tags.
Context is a dictionary that the key is what we will  use in the template and the value is the data we will send to the template.
<ul> & </ul> means the bulleted item in a list
<li> & <li/> means listed items.
